Hello guys, Developer Vaibhav here.
If you are facing issues with Windows defender in Windows11 I will solve your issue.
 
If you are not able to open Defender settings :

1.Open powershell as ADMINISTRATOR from search menu.
2.Enter the given code:

CODE:

Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.SecHealthUI -AllUsers | Reset-AppxPackage

After this you have to press enter. After the successful execution you wont see any statement appearing inyour POWERSHELL with RED COLOR. then you are good to go.

If you get statement in RED COLOR like:


"Reset-AppxPackage : Package was not found.
Windows cannot remove Microsoft.SecHealthUI_1000.22000.1.0_neutral__8wekyb3d8bbwe because the current user does not have that package installed. Use Get-AppxPackage to see the list of packages installed.
At line:1 char:51
+ Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.SecHealthUI -AllUsers | Reset-AppxPackage
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (:) [Reset-AppxPackage], COMException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException,Microsoft.Windows.Appx.PackageManager.Commands.ResetAppxPackageCommand"


then you have to enter 1 more code :

add-appxpackage -disabledevelopmentmode -register ((Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.SecHealthUI -allusers).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml')

after this you're done.
